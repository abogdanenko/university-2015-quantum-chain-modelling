# Quantum chain modelling
Solves [Lindblad equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindblad_equation) for
a chain of two-level atoms described by [Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaynes%E2%80%93Cummings%E2%80%93Hubbard_model)
hamiltonian.

The program, written in Python for [Sage]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SageMath) mathematical environment, allows user
to calculate time evolution of a chain of two-level atoms interacting with the
environment.

Main features:
- specify all computation  parameters interactively
- symbolic and numerical computations
- rich visualization (state and density matrix plots, animation)
- explore hilbert space subspaces interactively
- plot chain conductivity to investigate dephasing-assisted transport phenomenon

To get started, set *SAGE_LOAD_ATTACH_PATH* environment variable to project
path, import and evaluate worksheet files.
